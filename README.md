# Setup

1. Change to a directory suitable for your project on Unity.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Setup a virtual environment using the `requirements.txt` file. Following are the steps for a conda environment:
    1. `conda create -p ./.venv_unity_assignment python=3.9.7 pip`
    2. `conda activate ./.venv_unity_assignment`
    3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `test/generate_id.py` using an interactive job obtained using `srun`. Note down the 5 character unique ID generated.
5. Run `test/generate_id.py` using `sbatch` job. You may use `sbatch generate_id.sh` to do so. 
    Note down the 5 character unique ID generated by this job in the log file `generate_id-<job_number>.out`.
6. Paste the two unique IDs in the assignment on Gradescope.
